        <h2>Setting Up Your Herb Garden</h2>
        <p>Once you've chosen your herbs, it's time to set up your garden. Follow these steps to get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select a Location:</strong> Most herbs need 6-8 hours of sunlight per day. Choose a spot that meets the light requirements of your selected herbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Soil:</strong> Use well-draining soil. You can mix garden soil with compost or use a commercial potting mix for container gardening.</li>
            <li><strong>Plant the Herbs:</strong> Space the plants according to their needs. For example, basil and mint need more space to spread, while thyme and chives can be planted closer together.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Regularly:</strong> Herbs need consistent moisture. Water them when the top inch of soil feels dry, but avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Caring for Your Herb Garden</h2>
        <p>Proper care will ensure your herbs thrive and provide a steady supply for your kitchen. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prune Regularly:</strong> Pruning encourages bushier growth and prevents herbs from flowering, which can reduce their flavor. Snip off the top leaves regularly to promote new growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Fertilize Sparingly:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks. Over-fertilizing can reduce the flavor intensity of your herbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Pests:</strong> Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids and spider mites. Use natural insecticides or soap sprays to manage infestations.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect from Extreme Weather:</strong> Herbs can be sensitive to extreme temperatures. Provide shade during hot weather and consider moving potted herbs indoors during frosty periods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Harvesting Your Herbs</h2>
        <p>Harvesting your herbs at the right time ensures the best flavor and encourages further growth. Follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Harvest Early in the Day:</strong> Cut herbs in the morning when the essential oils are most concentrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Clean Tools:</strong> Use sharp, clean scissors or pruners to avoid damaging the plants and spreading diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Snip Above Leaf Nodes:</strong> Cut just above a pair of leaves or leaf nodes to encourage new growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry or Use Fresh:</strong> Use fresh herbs immediately for the best flavor. To preserve them, hang them in a cool, dry place to dry or freeze them in ice cube trays with water or oil.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Issues and Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>Even with the best care, you might encounter some issues. Here are common problems and solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yellow Leaves:</strong> Often a sign of overwatering or poor drainage. Check the soil moisture and adjust your watering schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Leggy Growth:</strong> Usually caused by insufficient light. Move your herbs to a sunnier spot or use grow lights to supplement natural light.</li>
            <li><strong>Wilting:</strong> Can be due to under-watering, over-watering, or root damage. Check the soil moisture and ensure the roots are healthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Pest Infestations:</strong> Use natural remedies like neem oil or insecticidal soap to control pests without harming your herbs.</li>
        </ul>
